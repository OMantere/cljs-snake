# snake-game

What better way to learn ClojureScript? :)

This is based on a tutorial at http://lambdax.io/blog/posts/2016-01-19-snake-game-part-1.html, 
and this is mostly not my work, so please redirect most of the credit that way...

## Setup

To get an interactive development environment run:

    lein figwheel

and open your browser at [localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449/).
This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload.
